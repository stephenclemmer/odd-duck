Assignment: Odd Duck Lab Project
Author: Stephen Clemmer

This application shows three pictures at random. Each picture is of an idea for a product. The user clicks on their favorite of the three. This continues for 25 rounds, at which point the user can press the "View Results" button to see a graph displaying the number of views and the number of votes for each product. The application saves user data on local storage, so that the graph will display cumulative data.
